## Benchmark Accuracy (27,218 Drug-Like Molecules, pH 7.4) from pKahub is hosted at: pkahub.ttk.hu.

| Method | Correct | Total | Accuracy |
|--------|---------|-------|----------|
| Previous heuristic (binary H-H, no caps) | 18,128 | 27,183 | 66.70 % |
| `heuristic_net_charge` (this release, with caps) | **18,850** | 27,183 | **69.34 %** |
| `predict_charge(mode='auto')` with full pipeline for borderline | ≥ 18,850 | 27,183 | ≥ 69.34 % |

Largest per-charge improvements:

| Expected charge | Previous | This release | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| +1 | 67.8 % | **77.1 %** | +9.3 pp |
| −1 | 54.8 % | **57.7 %** | +2.9 pp |
| 0  | 76.0 % | **76.1 %** | stable |

## Notes

- All 65-case tests run with the full tautomer + Dimorphite-DL + Henderson–Hasselbalch scoring pipeline. Dimorphite-DL is installed and active.
- In production with PubChem lookup enabled, additional experimental pKa anchors further improve accuracy for well-characterised compounds.
- Expected charges reflect the dominant protonation state at **pH 7.4** using published pKa values.
- The flavonoid group (G8) is a hard regression constraint — any change that produces [O−] on a flavonoid at pH 7.4 is treated as a failure regardless of overall charge.
- `heuristic_net_charge` returns charge 0 for keto-form warfarin (no OH detectable on the parent); `predict_charge(mode='auto')` correctly escalates to the full pipeline and returns −1.
