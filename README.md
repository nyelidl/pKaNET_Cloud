## 🔍 What This Tool Does

pKaNET Cloud+ determines the **dominant docking-relevant protonation state** of a small molecule at a user-defined pH using a tautomer-aware Henderson–Hasselbalch microstate-ranking workflow.

The workflow is designed for ligand preparation before molecular docking, molecular mechanics parameterisation, and cheminformatics dataset curation.

Main functions:

- Identifies ionisable sites using a calibrated SMARTS-based heuristic pKa table with context-aware rules for over 50 functional-group classes.
- Uses Dimorphite-DL-assisted ionisation-state enumeration, followed by pKaNET Cloud+ tautomer-aware microstate filtering and re-ranking.
- Ranks candidate microstates using a Henderson–Hasselbalch-inspired scoring function with multi-site charge-cap logic.
- Optionally queries **PubChem** for experimental dissociation-constant evidence when available.
- Returns the dominant microspecies as a **pH-adjusted SMILES** with formal charge.
- Provides a fast sub-millisecond `heuristic_net_charge()` path and a smart `predict_charge(mode='auto')` dispatcher for large-scale screening.
- Builds and minimises a 3D ligand structure using ETKDG followed by MMFF optimisation, with UFF fallback.
- Exports docking- and parameterisation-ready **PDB** and **SDF** files.

## 📊 External Benchmark — pKaHub-Derived Validation Subset

pKaNET Cloud+ was benchmarked against a docking-relevant subset derived from **pKaHub**, an experimental aqueous pKa database with macroscopic charge-state transition annotations.

### Benchmark Endpoint

The benchmark endpoint is **net-charge agreement at pH 7.4**. This checks whether pKaNET Cloud+ predicts the same dominant net formal charge as the pKaHub-derived reference annotation at physiological pH.

This benchmark is **not** a numerical pKa prediction benchmark. The reported agreement values must not be interpreted as pKa MAE, RMSE, or quantitative pKa accuracy.

### Drug-Like Screening Criteria

The validation subset was selected from a combined unified dataset by applying drug-like / small-molecule criteria.

| Property | Threshold |
|---|---|
| Molecular weight | 100–600 Da |
| H-bond donors | ≤ 7 |
| H-bond acceptors | ≤ 12 |
| logP | −3 to +6.5 |
| TPSA | ≤ 180 Å² |
| Rotatable bonds | ≤ 15 |
| Heavy atoms | ≥ 7 |

From 38,724 unique SMILES, 35,872 passed these criteria. The final validation subset contained 27,218 molecules prioritised for interpretable charge-state annotation and experimental pKa availability.

### Overall Results

| Dataset | Correct | Total with reference annotation | Agreement rate |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 65-case curated regression set | 65 | 65 | **100.00%** |
| pKaHub-derived validation subset | 18,850 | 27,183 | **69.34%** |

### Agreement by Expected Charge State at pH 7.4

| Expected charge | Count | Correct | Agreement |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| −4 | 7 | 1 | 14.3% |
| −3 | 84 | 14 | 16.7% |
| −2 | 694 | 310 | 44.7% |
| −1 | 7,495 | 4,321 | 57.7% |
| 0 | 12,146 | 9,240 | 76.1% |
| +1 | 6,386 | 4,923 | 77.1% |
| +2 | 309 | 41 | 13.3% |
| +3 or above | 62 | 0 | 0.0% |

### Interpretation

For monoprotic drug-like molecules, which represent the majority of practical lead-optimisation cases, pKaNET Cloud+ assigns the same dominant net charge as the pKaHub-derived reference annotation for approximately three out of four compounds. Agreement is highest for neutral molecules (76.1%) and monocations (77.1%), and lower for polyprotic and zwitterionic molecules, as expected.

The 8,333 disagreements (30.66%) are concentrated in molecules where at least one predicted ionisable site has a heuristic pKa within ±1.5 units of pH 7.4 and in strongly polyprotic species with charge magnitude ≥ 2, where multi-site pKa ordering is not recoverable from the heuristic table alone. The dominant failure modes are single-step over-prediction of basicity and single-step over-prediction of acidity.

## ⚡ Public API

Three public functions are available for programmatic and large-scale use:

```python
# Sub-millisecond heuristic estimate with multi-site charge caps
charge = core.heuristic_net_charge("CC(=O)O", ph=7.4)          # → −1

# Smart dispatcher: fast normally, full pipeline for borderline pKa or tautomeric risk
charge, mode = core.predict_charge("CC(=O)O", ph=7.4, mode="auto")

# Batch prediction — returns a pandas DataFrame
df = core.batch_predict_charges(["CC(=O)O", "CN", "NCC(=O)O"], ph=7.4, mode="auto")
```

`predict_charge(mode='auto')` automatically escalates to the full tautomer + Dimorphite-DL + scoring pipeline when:

- any detected site pKa is within 1.5 pH units of the target, or
- the molecule has ring systems but no detectable ionisable sites on the parent form, indicating tautomeric enol risk, such as warfarin supplied as the keto form.

The `heuristic_net_charge()` function applies two charge-cap rules that suppress systematic over-charging in the fast path: a **polyamine cap** and a **multi-acid cap**.

## 🔗 Integration with Anyone Can Dock

pKaNET Cloud+ is the default protonation engine in the [Anyone Can Dock](https://anyonecandock.streamlit.app/) web application, replacing the previous Dimorphite-DL-only pipeline.

```python
protonate_pkanet()
```

```text
input ligand → standardisation → Dimorphite-DL enumeration →
pKaNET Cloud+ ranking → dominant microspecies → 3D generation →
minimisation → docking-ready output
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- pKaNET Cloud+ uses a calibrated heuristic pKa table and microstate-ranking workflow, not a quantitative experimental pKa predictor.
- For borderline cases where one or more predicted site pKa values fall within ±1.5 units of the target pH, the predicted charge should be treated as uncertain. Use `predict_charge(mode='auto')` to escalate these cases automatically to the full pipeline.
- `heuristic_net_charge()` returns charge 0 for keto-form warfarin input because no OH group is detectable on the parent form; `predict_charge(mode='auto')` escalates to the full pipeline and returns −1.
- Net-charge agreement does not guarantee that the exact ionised atom or tautomer is correct, especially for polyprotic or zwitterionic molecules.
- The pKaHub-derived benchmark subset is a curated validation subset, not a redistribution of the complete raw pKaHub database.
- In the G12 drug regression panel, Gefitinib and Imatinib are assigned as +1, whereas Erlotinib and Osimertinib are assigned as neutral. EGFR inhibitors should be evaluated compound by compound rather than assigned a uniform charge class.
- The 65-case internal regression suite was run with Dimorphite-DL active. The large pKaHub-derived benchmark used the fast charge-estimation path. Using `predict_charge(mode='auto')` for the full benchmark may further improve agreement for borderline and polyprotic cases, at the cost of longer run time.

## ✅ Recommended Wording for Manuscript or ESI

> The protonation-state assignment module of pKaNET Cloud+ was evaluated using an internal chemically curated regression set (65 molecules, 100% net-charge agreement at pH 7.4) and a drug-like subset derived from the pKaHub experimental pKa database (27,218 molecules, 69.34% net-charge agreement at pH 7.4; Sipos-Szabó et al.). The benchmark endpoint was dominant net-charge agreement at pH 7.4, not numerical pKa prediction accuracy. The pKaHub-derived benchmark subset was curated to retain molecules with interpretable macroscopic charge-state annotations relevant to ligand docking. The complete raw pKaHub database was not redistributed; only curated validation outputs and disagreement summaries were provided for reproducibility. Full benchmark data and extended ligand preparation methodology are provided in the Supporting Information.

## 📌 Project Context

pKaNET Cloud+ is developed as part of the ligand-preparation workflow for Anyone Can Dock and related computational drug-discovery tools. The method improves docking-readiness by reducing common protonation-state errors caused by direct rule-based ionisation workflows, especially for imidazole-like motifs, flavonoids, phosphates/phosphonates, sulfonamide-like acids, zwitterions, warfarin-type enol acids, and drug-like polyprotic molecules.
